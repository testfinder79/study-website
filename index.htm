    <strong>Study Room Training</strong> was created to help enhance the learning of staff members who work in Health and Social Care. 
    We wanted to create an environment for people to come and learn, to gain confidence in their job role. 
    Here at the Study Room you will learn in a relaxed environment where there is an emphasis on practical training, 
    case studies, group discussion, and learning from each other. 
    <br><br>
    We have a vast amount of knowledge and have worked in Health and Social Care for over 25 years — from training as a Nursery Nurse 
    to becoming a Registered Manager of a Home Care agency. We have first-hand experience of what it's like to work out in the community, hospitals, and care homes.
    <br><br>
    We are an approved Training Provider with the <strong>Hertfordshire Care Providers Association</strong>, and our courses are also approved by 
    <strong>CPD Certification</strong>.
